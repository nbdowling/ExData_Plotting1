## Introduction

See Prof. Peng's original ReadMe file for the problem statement.

This repos containg 5 .R files and 4 .PNG files.

Note that "Project1.R" should be run before running any of the other scripts. This is so that the data gets
read into a data frame that the later 4 scripts can use.

Also note that "plot2.R" should be run before "plot3.R" & "plot4.R" so that "date_time" is set up correctly.
